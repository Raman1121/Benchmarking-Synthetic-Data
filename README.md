# Overview
## Quantitative Analysis
The quantitative analysis is conducted at two levels:
- **Overall** (across all the pathologies in the MIMIC dataset)
- **Conditional** (Each metric calculated separately for each pathology)

### Metrics
#### Generative Quality Metrics
- **Fr√©chet inception distance (FID)**
- **Kernel Inception Distance (KID)**
- **Inception Distance (IS)**
- **Image-Text Alignment**

#### Diversity and Mode Coverage Metrics
- **Precision** (How many synthetic samples map to regions covered by real samples)
- **Recall** (How much of the real data distribution is covered by the synthetic data)
- **Diversity** (How well does the density of synthetic samples match the density of real samples)
- **Coverage** (How many different modes (clusters) of the real data are represented by the synthetic data)

## Qualitative Analysis
The qualitative analysis is conducted by evaluating performance on downstream tasks. We use the following tasks for this:
- Multi-Label Classification
- Radiology Report Generation

# Usage

## Quantitative Analysis
### Generating Synthetic Data 
- Using your favourite T2I Model, generate synthetic samples for each prompt in the test set (MIMIC_Splits/LLAVARAD_ANNOTATIONS_TEST.csv).
- During generation, save the prompt and the corresponding synthetic image in a CSV file with columns '**prompt**' and '**img_savename**'. 
- Place the CSV file in **assets/CSV**
- Place the synthetic images in **assets/synthetic_images**

### Calculating Generative Quality Metrics
 

#### Global Metrics
```
cd Benchmarking-Synthetic-Data
./scripts/image_quality_metrics.sh
```
**Note:** Calculating FID, KID, etc can be memory intensive and might result in OOM. If this is your case, run the following:
```
cd Benchmarking-Synthetic-Data
./scripts/image_quality_metrics_memory_saving.sh
```
#### Conditional Metrics
```
cd Benchmarking-Synthetic-Data
./scripts/image_quality_metrics_conditional.sh
```
